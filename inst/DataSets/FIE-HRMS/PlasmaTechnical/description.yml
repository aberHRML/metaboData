MS_analysis: FIE-HRMS analysis was performed using an Exactive Orbitrap mass spectrometer with 20ul injected into a solvent flow. Data acquisition took place for 3 minutes with both positive and negative ionisation modes acquired simultaneously with two scanning events from 55-280 and 270-1200 m/z.
